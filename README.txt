Music_Shuffler

What Is This?
Music_Shuffler is a simple solution to a problem I had. The problem? I have too
much music to fit on my phone, as such how do I choose tracks for my phone? Why
using a pseudo random number generator. That's all this does. It copies X amount
of tracks to a folder (or device) based of a size you provide, and then
generates a playlist for it.

How Do I Use It
java -jar music_shuffler.jar -src (your music folder) -size (size in GB) -destFolder (destination Folder i.e. C:\TMP)
Note that there is a config folder in the root of the folder. Inside this config file you can put keywords of tracks you want to ignore i.e. "Beatles".

Have fun recode or redistribute if you want just don't claim it as your own.
